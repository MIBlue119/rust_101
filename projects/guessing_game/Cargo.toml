rand = "0.8.4" # Add the dependency library to build random numbers
#The number 0.8.3 is actually shorthand for ^0.8.3, which means any version that is at least 0.8.3 but below 0.9.0. Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version 0.8.3, 
#and this specification ensures youâ€™ll get the latest patch release that will still compile with the code in this chapter.
